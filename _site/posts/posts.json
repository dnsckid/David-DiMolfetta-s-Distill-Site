FOMC officials said in March meeting minutes that the purchases “were providing substantial support to the economy.” Such quantitative easing efforts have been in full throttle since last March when global coronavirus lockdowns began.\nThe Fed’s broad economic goals include inflation slightly above 2% as well as robust recovery in the labor markets. Powell reiterated that it’s unlikely that the Fed will raise interest rates this year and that most officials see rates remaining at near zero through 2023.\nHe also stressed the labor market recovery must be an “inclusive” effort, referring to labor data signaling American minorities being hit harder from the effects of the pandemic than others. He advised that continued social distancing and mask-wearing measures can aid in achieving sturdy recovery.\nThe Fed forecasts an economic expansion of 6.5% for this year and an unemployment rate declining to 4.5%.\nPowell previously told lawmakers the economy is a long way from employment and inflation goals, despite notable growth in areas of the economy such as home sales and retail sales.\nIn his March press conference, he said inflation needs to be “on track to exceed 2% moderately for some time” for the central bank to begin lifting interest rates again. The ambiguity has left market players wondering if the Fed may enact new policy sooner than planned amid an optimistic rise in several key areas of the economy, including labor market conditions.\nIn previous meetings and conferences, Powell did not say he was concerned over inflation conditions to reporters or lawmakers. In his Feb. 24 testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, he said that “inflation dynamics do change over time” but that they “don’t change on a dime.”\nING Economics analysts in a March 19 note said that “a more meaningful change in the Fed’s language” would manifest during the FOMC’s June meeting, predicting that a new view of economic forecasts will present itself as Covid recovery further advances.\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nLink to story: https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/citing-israeli-company-un-expert-urges-global-moratorium-on-sale-of-spyware-593001\nUnited Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression David Kaye cited Herzliya-based NSO Group in his proposal to impose a moratorium on the use of surveillance technology, according to a report filed to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday.\nKaye’s report articulated NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware as a “paradigmatic example” of private surveillance products and their mobile device hacking capabilities.\nThe report cited previous research on the Pegasus technology infecting devices as well as it being used as a surveillance tool in multiple European and Middle Eastern countries. “The market is shrouded in secrecy; indeed, our knowledge of the problem exists mainly because of the digital-forensic work of non-governmental researchers and tenacious reporting by civil society organizations and the media,” the report said. Computer interference, social engineering, and facial recognition are among other forms of surveillance discussed in the report.\nAn NSO spokesperson said the technology is designed to help save lives and to pursue terrorists possessing encryption capabilities.\n“Licensed use of this technology helps prevent terrorist attacks, stop drug and sex trafficking rings, and rescue kidnapped children, but it is not a tool to be weaponized against human rights activists or political dissidents,” the spokesperson said in an email to The Jerusalem Post.\nNSO Group’s technology has previously found its way into headlines, where it was allegedly used by Saudis to track down and murder journalist Jamal Khashoggi of The Washington Post. NSO CEO Shalev Hulio denied in February that Khashoggi was targeted by NSO products and technology\nFormer Israel National Cyber Authority chief Buki Carmeli, who also consults for NSO, said that NSO routinely “gives technology to governments” to fight terrorist groups and drug cartels by hacking their communications. NSO’s future plans include serving militaries and foreign law enforcement authorities to the extent that those authorities have the capacity to use its products.\nSources close to the Post have said previously that NSO is capable of shutting down cyber systems being abused by clients in real time.\n“We fully believe all companies in this space have an obligation to ensure the ethical use of its technology,” the spokesperson said, “and we are bolstering our already rigorous vetting process to be in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and have consistently sought the input of the human rights and intelligence community to help protect innocent people’s right to life, liberty and security.”\nYonah Jeremy Bob and Tamar Beeri contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n",

Still, the gains did not offset losses incurred in the first quarter, when Exxon’s market cap dropped by 45.6% and Chevron’s fell by 40.0%. Both companies spent the second quarter tightening their belts as Exxon said it plans to cut its U.S. workforce by up to 10% by the end of the year and with Chevron saying it could lay off up to 15% of its global workforce in the coming months.\nMany major oil companies, including BP PLC, announced in March almost $30 billion of combined spending cuts after failed negotiations of OPEC+ over oil production cuts sent West Texas Intermediate crude prices tumbling.\nRoyal Dutch Shell PLC took the biggest hit, down 12.2% to $122.1 billion. Further down the list, Italy’s Eni SpA and Canada’s TC Energy Corp. were each down at least 7% in the second quarter.\nA handful of oil and gas leaders moved up in market cap rankings. Oil refining giant Marathon Petroleum Corp. shifted three spots higher from the first quarter to 18, while Phillips 66 moved to spot 13 from 15. Occidental Petroleum Corp. rounded out the top 25 after listing in 27th place last quarter, placing its market cap at nearly $16.5 billion, down from close to $38 billion at the same time in 2019.\nIn June, several oil and gas producers filed for bankruptcy, including Chesapeake Energy Corp., Extraction Oil & Gas Inc., Lilis Energy Inc., Sable Permian Resources LLC and Chisholm Oil & Gas LLC. Moody’s downgraded the global pipeline sector’s outlook to negative from stable for the first time in part because U.S. drillers filing for Chapter 11 protection will more aggressively target their pipeline contracts than during the previous crisis. Companies across the industry have sought government assistance through programs developed to assist them through the downturn.\nThe S&P 500 Energy index strongly outperformed the S&P 500 in the second quarter, with June 8 being the peak of the outperformance, hitting 59%.\nWhile oil companies expect a slow recovery for global oil demand, WTI prices have continued to climb since the end of March, recovering nearly 92% during the second quarter from $20.48 per barrel on March 31 to $39.27/bbl upon the June 30 closing.\n\n\n\n",
